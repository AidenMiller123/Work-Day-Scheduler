# Module 5 Challenge
This application is a simple calendar application that allows the user to store activities or things they need to do throughout the day. There are timeblocks for each hour of the regular American work day, 8am to 5pm. Each timeblock is compared to the current hour and either displays gray for past, red for present, or green for the future times. Each thing the user inputs in the text box and saves will be stored to local storage and brought back to display on the page when the page loads.
